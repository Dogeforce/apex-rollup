# Contributions Welcome

If you'd like to submit a contribution to `Rollup`, please do.

When submitting a pull request, please do two things:

- ensure your dependencies have been installed and that any/all file(s) changed have had prettier-apex run on them (usually as simple as enabling "Format On Save" in your editor's options)
- ensure that any change to production code comes with the addition of tests. It's possible that I will accept PRs where _only_ production-level code is changed, if an optimization is put in place -- but otherwise, try to write a failing test first!
